# CAHrot
A silly tarot generator using data from Cards Against Humanity.

To use: copy **settings_default.php** and rename to **settings.php**. There are only 3 settings, all with comments. Easy peasy.

The data was borrowed from https://crhallberg.com/cah/. I did a lot of filtering to remove the more horrible results, but if I missed something super offensive please let me know.
